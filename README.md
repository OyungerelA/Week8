# Connections_Lab_Week8
Week 8 HW - Make a Node-Express app that incorporates Socket.io. Try to incorporate the following:
- At least one ‘emit’ event on the server-side and one ‘emit’ event on the client-side
- The ability to open 2 browser tabs and share data in real-time between the two

### Project Plan

In terms of structure and design, the screen will be divided into two parts where the left-half will consist of the circles and the other half will be for textual information or the chart-like representations of users in terms of age-group. When the users hovers on the circle, the color of the circle will change (or other animation I will decide later on) and when the users presses on it, the heading will be changed and the later half of the screen will display information of the app represented by that circle. At this moment, my idea is still quite rough and I really hope I can get feedback from professor and my peers so I can make improvements. At this moment, I'm also debating whether to add more data onto the dataset, as right now, it only holds two types of information. I'll continue to give it more thought, but as of right now, this is the plan that I have.

## Next Steps
For now, I have only fetched the data from my dataset and displayed it on my website. So my next steps would be to create the skeleton of my website, by making the respective containers and playing around with how I want my data to be exhibited. I'm a bit worried about my web application becoming too much of a data visualization page rather than a "web application", so I'll continue to give more thought on what interactions I could add to my webpage so that it becomes a more comprehensive and complete application that not only visualizes data but also gives the users a chance to interact with the data.
